I was interested in learning iOS mobile app development, so I followed a tuturial on Swift. 

https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1

I created a food tracker, where you can upload a picture, name the meal, and rate it out of 5 stars. You can delete meals you've created and edit them.

This was helpful in understanding how to connect UI to the code. XCode had an interface where I could drag different UI elements to create the layout. I also thought it was really helpful that Swift connects elements with actions and methods for you.

I ran into a couple problems with cropping pictures, and I had some errors because the tutorial seemed to not be using the latest apple versions/models.
